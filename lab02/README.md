1. The app uses JSX to call the stylesheet within curly braces and retreive the proper style components for that part.

2.  Anything placed within curly braces will be run as javascript code.  Curly braces allow JS functionality within JSX.

3. The asyc decorator ensures that a promise will be returned/there will always be a return value.

4. It uses states to set the selected image to the one the user wanted.

5. The section on line 8 is an anonymous function because because it calls an async function without a name.
