 CS 262 - lab 11 11/12/2021 Brian Langejans

This lab is based on https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/11quality/lab.html
I am making changes to my code from lab 9 for this lab.

Changes
- Added proper header documentation according to JSDoc.
- Added proper comments according to JSDoc.
- Removed unnecessary spaces.
- Separated chunks of code by logical groupings according to JSDoc.
- Several typos were detected, but I ignored them because they were last names.
