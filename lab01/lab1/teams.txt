2. 
a. None for either, just very basic HTML a couple years ago in high school.
b. I have only used GitHub for downloading other projects, not uploading.
c. I liked my first idea from the ideas.txt file, since I think its doable, and could scale differently depending how much we have
   the chance to integrate. I'm fine with most ideas, though I prefer something that has an achievable end goal, like something that
   has a good chance of being usable/downloadable from the app store by the end of the class.
