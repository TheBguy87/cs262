Ideas

1. Ecological reverve Tour app
After taking a tour of Calvin's ecological reserve and taking the nature walk in my biology class the other day, I realized that there
were a lot of signs around, but not much information on what various areas were or did.  A lot of the stuff I learned on the tour was
said by the professor but not listed anywhere else.  I thought a cool app idea would be a sort of virtual tour of that area of campus,
where users could scan small QR codes placed along the trail and see what various plants and structures were.  Whenever I walk to
that parking lot, I see lots of families and groups walking through, so I thought it could maybe be game-ified
by adding a points system, where you have to find and scan as many QR codes as possible. It encourages kids to learn about the local ecosystem,
as well as learn about what Calvin is currently working on in that area.  The project could also be expanded to include other areas of campus,
and list information about buildings and architecture around campus.

2. Phone laser tag.
I kind of thought it would be neat to have a laser tag app that can be run just through one device, without any attachments or equipment.
I have no clue how this would work, but might require camera usage, location tracking or maybe NFC somehow? Just thought this might be fun for
campus activities.
